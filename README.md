### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My learning journey started with **BASIC**, then **Pascal**, and then **C++**. When _Microsoft Windows_ is getting popular, I'm trying to make some GUI programming with **Borland Delhi**. With it, I make my first software as a professional for an internet cafe.
During my time in college, I took a teaching job for a computer class at SMA & SMP. For the class, I required to learn **Visual Basic**, **VBA**, and **Visual Foxpro**.

Now, I'm just an old-school programmer, mainly working with **PHP** & **Python**.

I currently work as a _software engineer_ for a company and a lecturer at **STMIK Mardira Indonesia**.
